Gravity is my game, and I'm here to learn all about it. As a theoretical physicist, I'm working on my PhD with the [Strong](https://strong-gr.com) group at the Niels Bohr Institute under the guidance of Professor [Vitor Cardoso](https://pages.centra.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/vcardoso/). My focus? Figuring out how matter and spacetime behave in the most intense gravitational conditions. To do that, I use a combination of analytical and computational methods to study the non-linear aspects of black holes and gravitational waves. Want to know more about my research? Check out the [Research](https://jredondoyuste.github.io/research/) page.

I've lived all over the place, but I grew up in [Leganes](https://madrilanea.com/2013/02/01/tierra-de-pintorescas-rotondas/), a town near Madrid. My family is from Monreal del Campo, a small village in Teruel known for its saffron. After completing my undergraduate degree at Complutense University in Madrid, I spent a year at the University of Manchester before moving to Canada to earn my master's degree at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program).

When I'm not tackling the mysteries of the universe, you can find me swimming or rock climbing. Want to learn more about me? Click [here](https://jredondoyuste.github.io/misc/).
