My name is Jaime, and I am originally from Madrid (Spain). 

I studied Physics and Mathematics in Madrid, with a one-year exchange at the University of Manchester. Soon in my degree I started asking myself questions about gravity, and so far I have suceeded in finding many more interesting questions (not so many answers). Right now, I am a master's student at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program). 

In this website you might find some of my research interests, publications, photos, or some other stuff. 

Website under construction.
