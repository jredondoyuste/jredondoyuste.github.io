My name is Jaime, and I am originally from Madrid (Spain). I am a PSI master's student at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program). Previously, I studied Physics and Mathematics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, with a one-year exchange at the University of Manchester. Early on in my degree I started asking myself many questions, mainly about gravity. So far I have suceeded in finding even more interesting questions, but I haven't had much success when it comes to finding answers. Some people like to call that doing science, so I decided to try to pursue a career doing what I have fun doing! 

During that time, I had the chance to work with Luis, Carlos and some others on semiclassical gravity and a bunch of other related topics (see the [Research](https://jredondoyuste.github.io/research/) tab for more info). Right now, I have becomed even more interested in quantum gravity phenomenology and how can we use gravitational waves to constraint gravity beyond General Relativity.

I also had some time to study philosophy and humanities at the [ELU](https://elufv.com), so I am always up for a coffee and deep questions. When I am not doing that or physics, you will probably have to look for me on a swimming pool. I am also a Dallas Mavericks and Real Madrid fan, and I just started into sports climbing, so probably will talk about that a lot.
