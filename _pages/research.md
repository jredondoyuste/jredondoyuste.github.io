### Quantum Gravity Phenomenology

General Relativity predicts its own doom in the form of singularities in the interior of the most compact objects that can exist in our Universe: Black Holes. One possible way to avoid the formation of those singularities is that quantum effects (existence of a minimal length or vacuum polarization, for example) modify the predictions of GR in those regimes. At the same time, we expect that a quantum theory of gravity will modify some of the assumptions that we make about spacetime (discreteness of space and time, Lorentz violations, non-locality, emergence,...). I am very interested in exploring the observable predictions of quantum gravity effects as well as on how can we use Gravitational Waves data from coalescences or collapses to constraint quantum gravity models. 

### Gravity as an emergent theory?

Given a BH spacetime, the gravitational effects at the horizon can be mapped to the physics of a (Carrollian) fluid living just outside the horizon. This is the well-known membrane paradigm. As it is well-known, fluid dynamics is an emergent phenomena that captures in a small number of parameters the macroscopic behaviour of a very high number of degrees of freedom. I would like to understand whether this mapping means that Einstein equations only emerge as the macroscopic description of a large number of fundamental degrees of freedom of gravity. Notice that the question on what are the actual degrees of freedom of gravity acquires a great importance. 

### Other topics that I find interesting

I am very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and the implications that these have for gravity, and whether we can design table-top experiments to test gravitational physics in the quantum regime. I am also curious about the possibilites of analogue systems to explore some aspects of strong gravity. I believe in particular that quantum optical systems could eventually become a very interesting tool to simulate complicated problems, among which kinematical aspects of gravity might be included. Finally, I would like to understand better why gravity (and geometry) in 4 dimensions is so special.
