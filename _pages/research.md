### Quantum Gravity Phenomenology

General Relativity predicts the existence of curvature singularities in the interior of Black Holes. Quantum theories of gravity generally provide mechanisms to avoid the formation of such singularities during collapse scenarios. I am very interested in studying whether Gravitational Wave signals of supernovae can detect deviations from the classical picture originating from these QG effects, and my [Bachelor's thesis](http://jredondoyuste.github.io/files/physthesis.pdf) was intended to be a warm-up exercise to tackle that problem. 

There are many other phenomenological consequences that we can look for, though. One such example are the physics of Exotic Compact Objects and the GWs that they emit during coalescenses. On the other hand, quantum gravity tipically modifies some assumptions on spacetime (discreteness, Lorentz violations, non-locality, emergence...) and I am very interested in exploring what are the physical consequences of those assumptions.  

### Gravity as an emergent theory?

There are several hint pointing towards spacetime being an effective description of some, more fundamental, degrees of freedom: the thermodynamical formulation of Black Holes

Given a BH spacetime, the gravitational effects at the horizon can be mapped to the physics of a (Carrollian) fluid living just outside the horizon. This is the well-known membrane paradigm. As it is well-known, fluid dynamics is an emergent phenomena that captures in a small number of parameters the macroscopic behaviour of a very high number of degrees of freedom. I would like to understand whether this mapping means that Einstein equations only emerge as the macroscopic description of a large number of fundamental degrees of freedom of gravity. Notice that the question on what are the actual degrees of freedom of gravity acquires a great importance. 

### Other topics that I find interesting

I am very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and the implications that these have for gravity, and whether we can design table-top experiments to test gravitational physics in the quantum regime. I am also curious about the possibilites of analogue systems to explore some aspects of strong gravity. I believe in particular that quantum optical systems could eventually become a very interesting tool to simulate complicated problems, among which kinematical aspects of gravity might be included. Finally, I would like to understand better why gravity (and geometry) in 4 dimensions is so special.
