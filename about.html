            Howdy! I am a PhD Student at the Niels Bohr Institute, in Copenhagen (Denmark). I work on black hole physics, gravitational waves, and drawing bridges between gravity and fluid dynamics. You can read more about my research in the <a href="research.html">Research</a> page, and find my CV <a href="CV_July_24.pdf">here</a> .
            <br>
            Beyond physics, I spend my time doing a variety of things. I enjoy climbing, and recently fell in love for crack climbing in Las Vegas. When I am travelling, I also like to take photographies in 35mm film. Have a look at <a href="gallery.html">the Gallery</a>! In the winter, I find comfort in art - mostly by watching old movies, or in the theater. You can learn more about my (personal) self in the <a href="blog.html">blog</a>, such as my favourite kanelsnegl in Copenhagen.
            <br>
            Before moving to Denmark, I lived in a variety of places. I grew up in Leganés, a town in the suburbs of Madrid, where I studied most of my undergrad. As a child I spent plenty of time in Monreal del Campo, a wonderful village where the best saffron of the world is grown. I studied part of my undergrad in Manchester, and endured enough rain for three lifetimes. Searching for better weather, I moved to Waterloo (Canada), to take part in the Perimeter Scholars International masters program at the Perimeter Institute. Despite not loving the weather, I survived without being attacked by geese. More recently, I spent the summer months in Princeton (New Jersey).

            Here are some albums that I enjoy lately:
            </p>
            <ul class="projectlist">
                <li>
                    <i>A dos</i>, by spanish-born, NY-based, wonderfully sweet guitarist and delicate songwriter Lau Noah.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Djesse vols.1-4</i>, by unfathomable musical talent Jacob Collier, whom I had the pleasure to see in Boston, and will see again very soon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Ritmo (the Chick Corea Symphony Tribute)</i>, project led by Josep Vincent and that I discovered thanks to "Hoy Empieza Todo" in Radio 3. It's the good old Chick Corea that we all love, but played by an orchestra. How would I not love it?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Schvitz</i>, which always makes my day immediately better, by Vulfpeck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Early Alfa Years</i>, by Casiopea. Just incredibly amazing music.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="collapsible-content">

                Here are some books that I've read recently:
            </p>
            <ul class='projectlist'>
        	<li>
		    <i>Cuentos Teluricos</i> (R. Cortes) - Currently reading and enjoying the delicious, mischiveous, playful and sometimes tear-inducing feverish dreams of the author.
		</li>
	        <li>
                    <i>A room of one's own</i> (V. Woolf) - I just finished this, and I am still digesting it. Come back in a couple of weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Niels Bohr</i> (A. Pais) - I don't typically read biographies, but I found it extremely interesting and very well written.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Dune: Messiah</i> (F. Herbert) - I did not like so much the first book, but I enjoyed much more this one. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Poeta en Nueva York</i> (F. García Lorca) - Lorca writes with a subjectivity and a way of looking at the world which is so magical and interesting. 
                </li>
        </div>

            Here are a some of the last movies I have loved:
          </p>
          <ul class='projectlist'>
            <li>
                <i>A fistful of dollars</i> (S. Leone) - Apparently a copy of a Kurosawa movie, but adding Morriconne and Eastwood to the mix makes it a masterpiece.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>National Theatre Live: Vanya</i> (A. Scott) - One of the most incredible theatrical experiences I had, and I was watching it through a screen!
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>El secreto de sus ojos</i> (J.J. Campanela) - This shows that one can make an incredible simple, astoundingly beautiful movie.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Persona</i> (I. Bergman) - I could not stop thinking about it for more than a week. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> (J. Schlesinger) - I was not expecting to like it so much, but I did.
            </li>
