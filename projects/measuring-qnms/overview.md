## The question

How many quasinormal modes, or linear combinations of them, can actually be measured in a high-SNR ringdown? And how does that number change as the assumptions get more realistic (priors on the amplitudes, coloured detector noise, a later start time)?

## The model

A single complex time series, uniformly sampled, linear in the mode amplitudes:

$$
h = Z A + n, \qquad Z_{kj} = e^{-i\omega_j t_k}, \qquad A \sim \mathcal{CN}(\mu_A, \Sigma_A), \quad n \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, \Sigma_n).
$$

Units are $G = c = M_f = 1$, and $t = 0$ is the start of the analysis segment. Each column of $Z$ is one mode. It can be a prograde $(\ell, m, n)$ mode, a retrograde or mirror mode ($\omega \to -\bar\omega$), or a quadratic mode at $\omega_1 + \omega_2$. Quadratic modes get free amplitudes, so the model stays linear, and their physical suppression goes into the prior.

## The one object everything reduces to

Every quantity we track is a function of the singular values $s_i$ of the **whitened, prior-weighted design matrix**

$$
\tilde Z = \Sigma_n^{-1/2}\, Z\, \Sigma_A^{1/2} = U\,\mathrm{diag}(s_i)\,W^\dagger .
$$

Each right singular vector is a *channel*: a fixed linear combination of mode amplitudes. We call a channel **measurable** when $s_i > 1$, meaning the data reduce its variance by more than a factor of two relative to the prior. See [derivations](#derivations) for why that threshold is natural. So the headline number is

$$
n_{\rm meas} = \#\{\, i : s_i > 1 \,\}.
$$

With white noise and a flat prior, $s_i = \rho\,\sigma_i(Z)$ with $\rho = \sigma_A/\sigma_n$. The problem is then just the singular spectrum of a Vandermonde-type matrix, cut at $1/\rho$.

## Where things stand (2026-09-24)

v1 (a complex signal, white or circulant noise, flat / PN / QNEF priors) is retired; its numbers remain in the [log](#log). v2 so far:

- **Phase A, done:** the complex strain $h = h_+ - i h_\times$ with mirror modes tied by equatorial symmetry; detector projections and networks; noise for O4, A+, ET, CE and LISA from their PSDs; modes up to $\ell = 8$.
- **Under discussion:** how to parametrize the amplitudes. See [derivations §10](#derivations).
- **Next:** the amplitude prior calibrated on NR (jaxqualin), then the figures in the [plan](#plan).

## Open threads

- Check the net QNEF × time-shift overtone scaling against jaxqualin / NR amplitude fits before trusting the PN + QNEF curves quantitatively.
- Pin down the $r_{44}$ PN coefficient: $(8/9)\sqrt{5/7}$ or $(8/9)\sqrt{10/7}$.
- Map channels back to modes: how much of each channel's weight sits on which $(\ell, m, n)$.
- Model nonmodal content as extra noise, either as a time-dependent variance or as NR residuals.
